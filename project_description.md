by Bintinger Nico, Federsel Vincent, Fornvald Roland, Mátyás Zsombor

## Title: QuanVi

### Overview:
QuanVi is a web-based application designed to simulate and visualize quantum circuits. It serves as an interactive platform where users can design, experiment with, and learn about quantum computing concepts in a dynamic and intuitive way. The tool provides users with the ability to build and simulate quantum circuits, helping users understand how quantum gates and qubits behave during different operations.

### Objectives:
- Create an intuitive editor to visualize and simulate quantum circuits using a plantuml like language.
- Develop an educational tool that allows users to experiment with various quantum gates and quantum states.
- Implement simulation and measuring

### Key Features:
- **Visual editor** for designing and manipulating quantum circuits.
- **Simulation** simulates different gates
- **Tutorials** and explanations to help users learn quantum computing concepts.
- Support for **various quantum gates** and quantum algorithms.
- **User-friendly interface** designed for learners, educators, and quantum computing enthusiasts.

### Target Audience:
- People who have and interest in the world of quantum computing.

### Project Milestones
 - Completion of product description and use case Diagram (Nico, Roland, Vincent) - 19.11.2024
 - Finished basic simulation of qbits and single qbit circuit elements (Zsombor) - 03.12.2024
 - Finished Basic CI/CD pipeline (Vincent) - 17.12.2024
 - Finished implementation of basic editor and visualizer (Nico, Roland) - 03.12.2024
 - Finished implementation of multi qbit circuit elements (Zsombor) - 17.12.2024
 - Finished implementation of user friendly tutorials (Nico, Roland, Vincent) - 21.01.2025
 - Completed creation of github action for testing (Vincent) - 19.11.2024

QuanVi provides a hands-on experience for users to deepen their knowledge of quantum circuits, making the abstract world of quantum computing more accessible.
